The scripts in this folder serve two purposes: generating and saving of Mascot demo outputs, and performing pixel-based tests.

## Visualization Output
To batch generate and save scene graphs, SVG graphics and raster images (PNG format) for the Mascot demos:

### Dependencies
puppeteer has been included as a dependency in package.json

### How to generate the files
1. In the Mascot root directory, start the web server using `npm run start`
2. `cd io` to change to this directory 
3. Generate and save the Mascot scene graphs and SVGs first by running `node sceneSVGWorker.js`
4. Then convert the SVGs to PNGs by running `node pngWorker.js`

## Pixel-based Tests
To compare the generated image output with the ground truth stored in the `demoScreenshots` at the pixel level:

### Dependencies
pngjs and pixelmatch have been included as a dependency in package.json

### How to run the tests
1. Generate PNGs by following the instructions above
